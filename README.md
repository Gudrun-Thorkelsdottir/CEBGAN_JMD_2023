## Dataset

Our airfoil designs are optimized airfoils in SU2. The original airfoils are generated by [BezierGAN](https://github.com/IDEALLab/airfoil-opt-gan-aiaa2019). BezierGAN was trained on [UIUC airfoil coordinates database](http://m-selig.ae.illinois.edu/ads/coord_database.html).

[//]: <The raw data contains variable number of points along airfoil curves. We created the training data by applying [B-spline interpolation](https://github.com/IDEALLab/airfoil-interpolation) on these designs and removed outlier designs.>

## CFD solver and airfoil optimization

We use [SU2](https://su2code.github.io/) as the CFD solver to evaluate the performance of the airfoil design.

## Usage

### Train/evaluate Conditional-Bézier-GAN

<!-- Go to Conditional-Bézier-GAN's directory:

```bash
cd conditional-bezier-gan
```

Train a Bézier-GAN or evaluate a trained Bézier-GAN:

```bash
python train_gan.py
```

positional arguments:
    
```
mode	train or evaluate
noise	noise dimension
```

optional arguments:

```
-h, --help            	show this help message and exit
--model_id		model ID
--save_interval 	number of intervals for saving the trained model and plotting results
```

The trained model and synthesized shape plots will be saved under directory `conditional-bezier-gan/trained_gan/<latent>_<noise>/<model_id>`, where `<latent>`, `<noise>`, and `<model_id>` are latent dimension, noise dimension, and model ID specified in the above arguments. -->
